This test file was created to illustrate branching in Git. The file was
included in two divergent branches with different contents in each branch.
The remaining content in this file (this comment) was added as a merge conflict
resolution when merging the branches.

PATCHING

This second hunk of text was added to practise patching changes to manage what
is being included in a commit. The goal is to add this hunk of text to the
index in preparation of the next commit. This hunk should be the last piece of
text in the following commit.
